The eyrie produced two chicks that successfully fledged (permanently left the eyrie) the first week of August, before migrating south for the winter. Since the chicks fledged, winter's icy grasp on the Yukon River landscape has come and gone. Normally, you could enjoy a rare, beautiful view from high above the Yukon River, but this spring's break-up pushed ice high onto the shoreline, destroying the site of the data repeater. The repeater was an essential link for transmitting the image at the nest to the rest of the world. When the ice retreats, we will attempt to reestablish this vital link. For now, please enjoy the photos below of last year's peregrine nestlings in the eyrie. Webcam is currently inactive."

This camera provides a daily image that allows Kenai Fjords National Park researchers to monitor the behavior of this lake and, by analyzing the photos, we are working to better understand the timing and frequency of the drainage events that lead to flooding in the proglacial lake at Bear Glacier's terminus. This camera was purchased with NPS recreational fee funds and is maintained and monitored by Kenai Fjords National Park. Updated 09/02/2020"

However, it is not broadcasting a clear picture at all. Our staff is not sure if this is a problem with the camera itself, the transmitter, or receiver, but it is certain that one or more of these units is malfunctioning. At this point in the nesting season, there is no opportunity to troubleshoot without negatively impacting the breeding eagle pair who are already sitting on at least one egg. Therefore, there will be no broadcast of Shiloh's eagle nest camera this year."

The valley offers a different, but still spectacular, contrast to the Going-to-the-Sun Road, inside the park. This section of the park offers some of the most challenging and remote experiences Glacier has to offer. The highlight of this view is the dramatic glacier-carved horn of Mount Saint Nicholas (elev. 9376 ft.). Does it remind you of any other peak? How about the Matterhorn in the European Alps? Both formed in the same way. When glaciers carve on three or more sides of a peak at the same time they form these classic glacial horns. We have several other horns in the park but no better representation than Saint Nicholas."

Terraces form when water rises through limestone, which then allows the water to carry high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and the calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. In the foreground are the parade grounds for historic Fort Yellowstone—the focal point of daily life at the fort. Each day began early with a bugler sounding Reveille. Another bugle call brought horse-mounted soldiers trotting onto the field for the flag-raising. Assignments were then announced. Troops either headed out to patrol the Mammoth Hot Spring Terraces and other nearby attractions, or remained at the fort to care for the horses. At dusk, the bugler called all troopers back to the grounds for the lowering of the flag, and the day was concluded with a cannon firing from the top of Capitol Hill. Taps was played as lights winked out and quiet settled over the fort."
