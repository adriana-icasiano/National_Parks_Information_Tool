The valley offers a different, but still spectacular, contrast to the Going-to-the-Sun Road, inside the park. This section of the park offers some of the most challenging and remote experiences Glacier has to offer. The highlight of this view is the dramatic glacier-carved horn of Mount Saint Nicholas (elev. 9376 ft.). Does it remind you of any other peak? How about the Matterhorn in the European Alps? Both formed in the same way. When glaciers carve on three or more sides of a peak at the same time they form these classic glacial horns. We have several other horns in the park but no better representation than Saint Nicholas."

Terraces form when water rises through limestone, which then allows the water to carry high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and the calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. In the foreground are the parade grounds for historic Fort Yellowstone—the focal point of daily life at the fort. Each day began early with a bugler sounding Reveille. Another bugle call brought horse-mounted soldiers trotting onto the field for the flag-raising. Assignments were then announced. Troops either headed out to patrol the Mammoth Hot Spring Terraces and other nearby attractions, or remained at the fort to care for the horses. At dusk, the bugler called all troopers back to the grounds for the lowering of the flag, and the day was concluded with a cannon firing from the top of Capitol Hill. Taps was played as lights winked out and quiet settled over the fort."
